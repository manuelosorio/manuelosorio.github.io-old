![Fear Of Success](../../../../../assets/img/blog/FearOfSuccess.png "Fear Of Success")


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often people create something new and are too afraid to publish it. They feel like they are afraid to fail. Think to yourself; when you're afraid of something don't, you usually do whatever it takes to avoid it? If you were truly afraid to fail they wouldn't let failure become an obstacle of success. By not publishing your work you are setting yourself to fail. What I mean by that is that instead of avoiding failure you're actually welcoming it into your life. I was discussing this topic with a friend and she gave me a great quote.

> "Fear of success is fear of the unknown. Too often we cling to failure because we are familiar with it."
> &nbsp;&nbsp;~ Unknown

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really like that quote because it says we fear success since we aren't familiar to what will come out of it. I myself have always put the excuse of fearing failure when I wanted to successfully do something new. What I never realized is that by using that excuse I was actually failing. I have wanted to start a blog for several months now because I feared the responsibilities and commitment to my website which success will force upon me.

> "I learned courage was the absence of fear but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear."
> &nbsp;&nbsp;~ Nelson Mandela


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That made me realize something very important, if you want to succeed you must get over your fear. I'm challenging myself to try new things like, this blog for example because I want to be successful in everything I do.


Untill next time,
