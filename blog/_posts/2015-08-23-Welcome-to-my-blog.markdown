![Welcome to my Blog](../../../../../assets/img/blog/Welcome.png "Welcome to my blog")

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello Guys Welcome to my blog, I'm excited your here. I like to tell you a little bit about myself. My name is Manuel Osorio. I'm a graphic/web designer and I enjoy the full process behind design. I wanted to start a blog for a while now but never did because feared what would come of it, and thought I could never actually be a writer. Than I was making excuses for myself. I decided that if I want to do something I needed to stop making excuses and do what I was going to say. I want to start this blog so I'm risking my credibility. On Wednesday, September 30, 2015. I will officially be launching this blog to the public. As I test the waters of having a blog I will only make a new post every 2 weeks on Wednesday.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you any thoughts for my blog don't hesitate to leave a comment below. I hope that once I release the blog I can provide you guys with any type of value.

Untill next time,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~ Manuel Osorio
